# Spam Filter using Naive Bayes

## Building a spam filter from scratch using the Naive Bayes algorithm

In machine learning, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes theorem with strong (but naive) independence assumptions between the features. In probability theory and statistics, Bayes' theorem (alternatively Bayes law or Bayes rule) describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

The aim of this project is to build a spam filter using Naive Bayes algorithm from scratch. Leveraging the Bayes theorem the model is built to predict the probability that a given text is spam or non-spam based on the training data exposed to the model.

The dataset consists of text messages and a target variable specifying whether the text message was a spam or not. The dataset has been picked up from [the UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection).

   "In machine learning, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple \"probabilistic classifiers\" based on applying Bayes theorem with strong (but naive) independence assumptions between the features. In probability theory and statistics, Bayes' theorem (alternatively Bayes law or Bayes rule) describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. \n",
